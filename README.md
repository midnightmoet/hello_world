# hello_world
 A place where you store ideas, resources, or even share &amp; collaborate/discuss things with others
 
 I have been in healthcare for most of my life and in the end of 2020 made the decision to completely change careers.  I applied Kingsland University for their Zero to Blockchain program for their first cohort of 2021.  It has been a struggle because I chose fast track while working full time BUT I am excelling which tells me I made the right move.
 
 The program starts teaching the skills to be a Full Stack Web Developer and then goes on to teaching the Blockchain portion.  Along the way it also gives the right environment to collaborate with other developers and students who have chosen this path.
